# Udacity hotel reservation app

## Description
This is my implementation of the first (out of three) project in Udacity's Java Programing Nanodegree.

I wrote this console app from scratch based on architecture suggested in the course. The project demonstrates designing
classes using OOP, organizing and processing data with collections, and using common Java types.

This app allows customers to find and book a hotel room based on room availability. The following screenshots
demonstrate the functionality implemented.
