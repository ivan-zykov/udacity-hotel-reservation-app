# Udacity hotel reservation app

## Description
This is my implementation of the first out of three projects in Udacity Java Programing Nanodegree.

I wrote this console app from scratch based on architecture suggested in the course. The project demonstrates:
- designing classes using OOP
- organizing and processing data with collections
- using common Java types
- using Maven to organise third-party libraries
- unit testing and mocking dependencies.

This app allows customers to find and book a hotel room based on room availability. Following screenshots
demonstrate the functionality implemented.
